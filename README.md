Password Calculator
===================

Password Calculator takes a master password, your name and a site name to calculate a password. The password - and of course the master password - will never be stored, it will always be calculated.

This means, you do not have to save a key store file. Every password can be calculated any time, anywhere. This is possible because you know the necessary information.

    Your name + Master password + Site name = Your password for the site

The password generator is published on http://arthurzaczek.github.io/PasswordCalculator/
